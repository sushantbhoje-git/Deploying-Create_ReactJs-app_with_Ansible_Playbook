# Deploying Create React App with Ansible Playbooks

## Overview
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy a React application using Ansible playbooks to both a Red Hat and Ubuntu server. The process involves setting up Ansible playbooks to automate the deployment process for Create React App on different server environments.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Ansible
- Access to Red Hat and Ubuntu servers
- Create React App project configured for deployment
- Ansible installed on the control machine

## Understanding Tasks in Ansible Playbook

1. Install Node.js, npm, and Git on RedHat machine if not already installed, updating the package cache before installation.
```` bash
- name: Install Node.js and Git  
  dnf:                          
    name:                        
      - nodejs
      - npm
      - git
    state: present               
    update_cache: yes            
  when: ansible_distribution=="RedHat"  
  tags:

2. Install Node.js, npm, and Git on Ubuntu machine if not already installed, updating the package cache before installation.
```` bash
- name: Install Node.js 16 and Git on Ubuntu machine
  apt:
    name:
      - nodejs
      - git
      - npm
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
  when: ansible_distribution=="Ubuntu"
  tags:
    - 2
````

3. This Ansible task clones a Git repository into the "/app" directory, forcefully overwriting any existing content.
```` bash
- name: Clone Git repository into the "/app" directory, forcefully overwriting any existing content.
  git:
    repo: https://github.com/harshm1225/create-react-app.git
    dest: /app
    force: yes
  tags:
    - 3
````

4. This Ansible task installs project dependencies using npm within the "/app" directory.
```` bash
- name: Install project dependencies with npm within the "/app" directory.
  command: /usr/bin/npm install
  args:
    chdir: /app
  tags:
    - 4
````

5. This Ansible task runs npm build within the "/app" directory, based on the distribution being RedHat or Ubuntu.
```` bash
- name: Run npm build within the "/app" directory, based on the distribution being RedHat or Ubuntu.
  block:
    - command: /usr/bin/npm run build
      args:
        chdir: /app
  when: ansible_distribution == "RedHat" or ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"
  tags:
    - 5
````

6. This Ansible task installs the Apache Web Server on an Ubuntu machine using the apt package manager.
```` bash
- name: Install Apache Web Server on Ubuntu machine using the apt package manager.
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: latest
  when: ansible_distribution=="Ubuntu"
  tags:
    - 6
````

7. This Ansible task installs the Apache Web Server on Redhat machine using the yum package manager.
```` bash
- name: Install Apache Web Server on RedHat machine using the yum package manager.
  yum:
    name: httpd
    state: latest
  when: ansible_distribution=="RedHat"
  tags:
    - 7
````

8. This task ensures Apache Web Server is enabled and started on Ubuntu machines.
```` bash
- name: Enable Apache Web Server Service on Ubuntu machine
  service:
    name: apache2
    enabled: true
    state: started
  when: ansible_distribution=="Ubuntu"
  tags:
    - 9
````

9. This task ensures Apache Web Server is enabled and started on RedHat machines.
```` bash
- name: Enable Apache Web Server Service on RedHat machine
  service:
    name: httpd
    enabled: true
    state: started
  when: ansible_distribution=="RedHat"
  tags:
    - 10
````

10. This task copies the index.html file from the /app/build/ directory to the default Apache document root (/var/www/html/) on the target machine.
```` bash
- name: Copy index.html to Default Apache Document root
  copy:
    src: /app/build/
    dest: /var/www/html/
    remote_src: yes
  tags:
    - 11
````

11. This task sets Apache file permissions on RedHat systems, ensuring the /var/www/html directory is owned by 'apache' user and group with permissions 0755. It's essential for Apache to access and serve files correctly.
```` bash
- name: Set file permissions for Apache on RedHat
  file:
    path: /var/www/html
    owner: apache
    group: apache
    mode: "0755"
  when: ansible_distribution=="RedHat"
  tags:
    - 12
````

12. This task sets file permissions for Apache on Ubuntu, ensuring that the /var/www/html directory is owned by 'www-data' user and group with permissions 0755. This setup facilitates Apache's ability to access and serve files correctly.
```` bash
- name: Set file permissions for Apache on Ubuntu
  file:
    path: /var/www/html
    owner: www-data
    group: www-data
    mode: "0755"
  when: ansible_distribution=="Ubuntu"
  tags:
    - 13
````

13. This task removes SELinux permissions and restores them to default for RedHat systems. It utilizes the restorecon command to recursively restore context on the /var/www/html directory.
```` bash
- name: Remove SELinux permissions and set to default for RedHat
  command: restorecon -Rv /var/www/html
  when: ansible_distribution=="RedHat"
  tags:
    - 14
````

14. This task removes SELinux permissions and sets them to default for Ubuntu systems by using the chcon command. It assigns the SELinux context system_u:object_r:default_t to the /var/www/html directory.
```` bash
- name: Remove SELinux permissions and set to default for Ubuntu
  command: "chcon system_u:object_r:default_t /var/www/html"
  when: ansible_distribution=="Ubuntu"
  tags:
    - 15
````

15. This task restarts the Apache service on RedHat systems using the service module. It ensures the service named 'httpd' is restarted.
```` bash
- name: Restart Apache service on RedHat
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: restarted
  when: ansible_distribution=="RedHat"
  tags:
    - 16
````

16. Please ensure that you open the inbound security group for port 80 to access the hosted site on your RedHat and Ubuntu machines, which in my case are deployed on AWS.
